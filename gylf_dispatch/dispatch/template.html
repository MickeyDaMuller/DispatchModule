						            Warm  greetings in the precious and matchless name of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus  Christ.<br>
						            <br>
						            This  is still our month of <strong>Prayer</strong>.  Ephesians 6:18 says, &quot;Praying always with all prayer and supplications in the  Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all  saints.&quot;<br />
						            <br />
						            Prayer  is a privilege and an honour as it is an investment for eternity. When we pray,  we are fellowshipping with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Why should we  pray?<br />
						            <br />
						            a)  Prayer seasons and enriches our spirits as we get connected to the Lord's  ideas, visions and leading more easily in order to change the world.<br />
b)  As we pray we make tremendous power available, causing changes in our favour.  It enables us to change circumstances. <br />
c) Prayer provides a rich  communion with the Lord.
